# Projects

I've worked on many different projects over the time, and some are really fun to play with.

> This page is a small collection of my favorite projects. These are mostly recent ones from 2024 and 2025, but I have many more projects that I worked on in the past. Some of them - not all though - tend to have awful coding quality and are not useful enough to be "re-mastered", so to say!

They're grouped into small categories for a better overview!
