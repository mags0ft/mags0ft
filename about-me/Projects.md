# Projects

I've worked on many different projects over the time, and some are really fun to play with.

> This page is a small collection of my favorite projects. These are mostly recent ones from 2024 and 2025, but I have many more projects that I worked on in the past. Some of them - not all though - tend to have awful coding quality and are not useful enough to be "re-mastered", so to say! Those are not listed here.

They're grouped into small categories for a better overview!

## Artifial Intelligence and Large Language Models

- [Jace](https://github.com/mags0ft/Jace) - A proof-of-concept for the council-of-models method, which allows you to mix several LLMs together and have them discuss over a problem.

- [Jacob](https://huggingface.co/jacob-ml/jacob-24b) - A project to bring strong linguistic capabilities to produce text resembling German "Leichte Sprache" (Easy Language) into LLMs like Mistral Small 3.2 24b, made in cooperation with federal associations for people with special needs.

- [hle-eval-ollama](https://github.com/mags0ft/hle-eval-ollama) - An easy-to-use evaluation tool for running Humanity's Last Exam on (locally) hosted Ollama instances. Featured in Ollama's `README.md`!

- [Heavy participation](./Contributions.md) at [Alpaca](https://github.com/jeffser/Alpaca), an easy-to-use, adaptive Ollama client that works with any other OpenAI-compatible API.

- [NexaStrat](https://lichess.org/@/NexaStrat) - An average-playing chess AI to face intermediate players for training, originally fully written in Python using the `python-chess` library (scored ~1520 Elo points), now replaced by a custom Transformer trained from scratch for several days on millions of chess games.

## CPU design

- [JoltCore-16](https://github.com/mags0ft/JoltCore-16) - Fully self-designed 16-bit RISC CPU with custom ISA, 128 KiB of RAM & ROM, 8 I/O ports, self-written assembler and emulator; extended during a school project mentored by ARM co-creator Steve Furber.

- [Informatikbiber](https://bwinf.de/biber/) - Participation in the "Informatik-Biber" (Computer Science Beaver) competition.
- [INVENT a CHIP 2025](https://www.invent-a-chip.de/invent-a-chip) - Hardware design competition, open-source repository with solutions will be published after the competition ends.

## Data & processing

- [spamfilter](https://github.com/mags0ft/spamfilter) - Streamlined, object-oriented and fully customizable Python spam filtering library. [Available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spamfilter/) as `spamfilter`.
