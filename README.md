**Welcome to whoever is reading this**, I am **mags0ft** and love to write software - especially web applications, LLM tools and some experimental stuff - whenever I'm able to _allocate_ some time for that.

I like to code in Python (Flask, 🤗 Transformers, 🦥 Unsloth), work with Next.JS and generally love to build a lot of tools way too complex for simple tasks.

Feel free to look around a little bit! These [projects](./about-me/Projects.md) are worth a glance:

- 💻 a fully custom designed [16-bit CPU](https://github.com/mags0ft/JoltCore-16)
- 🐍 my Python library [spamfilter](https://github.com/mags0ft/spamfilter), available at PyPI
- ✨ [Jace](https://github.com/mags0ft/Jace), a tool to mix several LLMs (AI models) together
- ... 👉 [many more!](./about-me/Projects.md)
