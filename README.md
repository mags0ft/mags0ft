Welcome to whoever is reading this, I am mags0ft and love to write software, especially web applications and some experimental stuff, whenever I'm able to _allocate_ some time for that.
I like to code in Python along with Flask, work with Next.JS and generally love to build tools way too complex for a simple task.

Feel free to look around a little bit. These [projects](./about-me/Projects.md) are worth a glance:
- üíª a fully custom designed [16-bit CPU](https://github.com/mags0ft/JoltCore-16)
- üêç my Python library [spamfilter](https://github.com/mags0ft/spamfilter), available at PyPI
- üöó the kind of improvised backup manager [Lorean](https://github.com/mags0ft/Lorean)
- ... [many more!](./about-me/Projects.md)
