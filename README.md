### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm mags0ft!

Welcome to whoever is reading this, I am mags0ft and like to write software, especially web applications and some experimental stuff, whenever I'm able to _allocate_ some time for that.
I like to code in Python with Flask, currently learn Next.js and love to build tools way too complex for a simple task.

Feel free to look around a little bit. I guess these projects are worth a glance:
- my Python library [spamfilter](https://github.com/mags0ft/spamfilter), available at PyPI
- a fully custom designed [16-bit CPU](https://github.com/mags0ft/JoltCore-16)
- the kind of improvised backup manager [Lorean](https://github.com/mags0ft/Lorean)

**More might be coming soon!**
